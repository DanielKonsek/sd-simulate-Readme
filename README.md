## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

With this tool, you can display and analyze UML state diagrams to get a better understanding of how transitions and regions interact with each other.
<br/>

* generate the corresponding reachability graph
* reachability analysis
* Maxnode analysis to find a transition sequence covering as many states as possible
* Maxtransition analysis to find the longest transition sequence possible

<br/>

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fmidue/sd-simulate
   ```
   or Download and save locally
2. Install [Cairosvg][cairosvg-package]
   ```sh
   pip install pycairo
   ```
3. Install [Graphviz-pylib][graphviz-package]
   ```sh
   pip install graphviz

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
<a name="Usage"></a>
## Usage
<br/>
<strong>Load UML Diagram</strong> and navigate to the .svg or .txt file containing your graph <br>
<strong>Show containtment</strong> to highlight the currently active region in red <br>
<strong>Hint</strong> to highlight the currently reachable states <br>
<strong>Show State Diagram Graph</strong> to generate the corresponding [reachability graph][product-screenshot2] <br>
<strong>Reachability analysis</strong> find all reachable states from the initial state <br>
<strong>Max Node Analysis</strong> find a transition sequence that contains as many states as possible <br>
<strong>Max transition Analysis</strong> to find a transition sequence that contains as many transitions as possible <br>
